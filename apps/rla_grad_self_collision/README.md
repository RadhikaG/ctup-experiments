This app evaluates batched gradient of self collision signed distances (blaze backend).
The batched FK calc is fully sparsified (sparse math as well as memory).
The spatial jacobian calculations are partially sparse-ified (sparse math but dense memory, not col-sparse).
The gradient calc for each sphere is a dense extern.

* Files in gen/ are generated by `samples/batched_grad_self_collision.cpp`
* Full generation script is: `helper_scripts/generate_sd_grad.sh`
