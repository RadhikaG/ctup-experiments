This app evaluates scalar and batched spatial jacobian (blaze backend) with all optimizations turned on for different robots.

* Files in gen/scalar are generated by `samples/scalar_spatial_jacobian.cpp`
* Files in gen/batched are generated by `samples/batched_spatial_jacobian.cpp`
* Full generation script is: `helper_scripts/generate_spatial_jacobian.sh`
